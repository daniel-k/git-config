My personal git config
======================

This is mainly a reminder for myself and a backup of my config. Please feel free
to use as you like.

# Install 

1. Put `git-rewip` somewhere in your `PATH`
2. `cp .gitconfig ~`

# Highlights

 * `git ri HEAD^^^`: interactive rebase 3 commits (use as many `^` as you like)
 * `git wip`: commit all changes as 'wip' commit
 * `git rewip`: undo 'wip' commit
